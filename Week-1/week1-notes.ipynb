    "\n",
    "Python is an **interpreted** programming language. In a **compiled** programming language such as C++ or Java, source code is written and then sent to a compiler. The compiler translates the source code into machine code, which gives instructions to the computer hardware. The entire translation process is completed *before* the program is run. An executable (often a `.exe` file) is created, which can be run many times without re-translating the source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an **interpreted** language, the source code is instead sent to the interpreter, which reads a few lines of source code and then executes them. This process continues, with the interpreter alternating between reading and executing code until the source code ends."

    "## Python Programming Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different programming environments in which to develop Python code. In all truth, any basic text editor can be used to write Python code. However, a dedicated Python programming environment greatly reduces the barrier to developing and maintaining good Python code. Each environment or program has its own strengths and weaknesses (subject to the opinion of this author). In this section, we'll explore some of the most popular options for Python programming. These are divided into three headings: IDLE, third-party integrated environments (those not developed by or affiliated with the Python Foundation), and Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IDLE\n",
    "The simplest environment for Python programming is the Integrated DeveLopment Environment (IDLE). This environment comes with any distribution of Python, which can be downloaded for free from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/). It is accessed from the command line in Linux/Unix, or from the command prompt in Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, after downloading and installing Python on a Windows computer, you can enter the Python IDLE as seen in the next screenshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/pythonIDLE.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first yellow arrow is pointing to the command used to enter IDLE. In either the Linux terminal or Windows command prompt, simply type `python`. This enters the Python IDLE. The second yellow arrow indicates the version of Python that you are using. In this case, the version is Python 3.6. You can always tell if you are in the Python IDLE by either the three brackets `>>>` indicating the beginning a line of Python code, or by scrolling to the top of the screen and searching for the version of Python. You can exit IDLE by typing `exit()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of IDLE\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> Free to use and comes with Python distribution </li>\n",
    "    <li> Keeps a running list of all previously entered commands, which you can access by pressing the `up` key on your keyboard </li>\n",
    "    <li> Great for short, simple projects or small calculations </li>\n",
    "    <li> Comes with a simple editor for writing Python scripts </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shortcomings of IDLE\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> Requires local installation of Python </li>\n",
    "    <li> Very bare-bones code editor </li>\n",
    "    <li> Writing and execution of Python code is kept separate, slowing down the development process </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Third-Party Integrated Environments (PyCharm, Eclipse, etc)\n",
    "These are powerful development environments for writing Python **scripts**. A **script** is a collection of Python code that accomplishes some user-specified task. These programming environments are desktop applications that the user downloads and installs locally on their computer. They are typically very feature-rich, with support for multiple programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of Third-Party Environments\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> Tons of features for writing and debugging code in many languages </li>\n",
    "    <li> All-in-one code writing and execution </li>\n",
    "    <li> Often free to download, sometimes open source </li>\n",
    "    <li> Code correction features reduce syntax errors (which we'll discuss later) </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shortcomings of Third-Party Environments\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> The many features can be overwhelming and carry a steeper learning curve </li>\n",
    "    <li> Many features will never be used, meaning there is computer memory being taken up by unused programs </li>\n",
    "    <li> Often they are free, but sometimes they require the purchase of a license to use the full version </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some third-party development environments to consider are [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), or the stellar [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Anaconda facilitates code development, external package management (which we'll discuss later), and access to the next option for Python development, the Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "These notes are written in a Jupyter notebook. Within the Jupyter notebook format, the user can combine HTML, Markdown (text), Python code, and many other technologies and languages. Within the same document, Python code, formatted text, Javascript, the R statistical language, Ruby code, GitHub terminal commands, and many other technologies exist in separate cells, and can communicate with each other. At the University of Calgary, all students have access to the [Syzygy server](https://ucalgary.syzygy.ca), which means that nothing needs to be downloaded locally. All code is written, saved, and run on the remote server.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> Multiple technologies combined into one format </li>\n",
    "    <li> No local installation needed (unless you use Anaconda) </li>\n",
    "    <li> Easy to share code with others </li>\n",
    "    <li> Used by more and more projects and companies each month </li>\n",
    "    <li> Convenient format for exploring and sharing ideas </li>\n",
    "    <li> Relatively easy to create interactive visuals </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shortcomings of Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> Hard to develop large projects with multiple users contributing </li>\n",
    "    <li> No code correction feature </li>\n",
    "    <li> Hard to test code </li>\n",
    "    <li> The Syzygy server automatically signs you out every 30 minutes! (this doesn't happen if you install Anaconda) Arggggh! </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, I'll mainly use Jupyter notebooks as a teaching tool. In my own research and development work, I've used Jupyter to try out ideas, to create interactive educational tools, and to communicate ideas to other researchers. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use another method of Python development, that is completely fine with me. It generally best practice to have at least tried all three types of Python development listed above. Once you find one that you are comfortable with, you can use that as your main development tool and then use the others as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using IDLE Within a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "For fast testing of code, you can use IDLE within a Jupyter notebook in two ways. First, you can enter the code in a single code cell and run it by pressing `Shift` + `Enter`. Second, you can run IDLE from the main window in Syzygy. To do this, go to the Syzygy tab in your browser (it should be labeled 'Home'). Go to the far right of the screen and click the 'New' dropdown menu. Then click the 'Terminal' option. This opens a Linux terminal. The screenshot below shows how this is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/jupyter_terminal.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, simply type `python`, and you're in IDLE!"

    "## Types of Errors in Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax Errors\n",
    "Because Python is a programming language, developers must be careful to follow the rules of the language. A syntax error is when the rules of the language are broken. For example, suppose I wrote the English sentence: \"do you have any mustard\". I have clearly broken two rules of the English language. First, I didn't start the sentence with a capital letter. Second, I didn't end the sentence, which takes the form of a question, with a question mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has similar rules relating to its structure. Unlike English, Python's rules are absolutely strict and must be followed to produce meaningful output. We can read a poorly written English sentence and still understand its meaning. The Python interpreter can't read or parse a poorly written statement in Python and still 'get the gist' of what you were trying to do. If you make a syntax error in Python, the interpreter will complain by spitting out an error message. In Python, you must follow the rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Runtime Errors\n",
    "These subtle errors only appear once the program is run, hence their name. In Python, we also call these **exceptions**. They usually mean that the interpreter has taken exception with something you tried to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a runtime error would be something like `'hello' > 1`. We'll talk more about data types later, but the problem with this statement is that we are trying to compare a word to an integer. There is no way to compare these two data types, since a word has no numerical value. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there's no problem with the *syntax* of the statement `'hello' > 1`. Python doesn't see anything wrong with what you *wrote*, but it takes exception with what you are trying to *do*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Semantic Errors\n",
    "These are the hardest errors to find. A semantic error is when the program runs without any problems, but it doesn't do what you expect it to do. Instead, it will do exactly what you *told* it to do. To correct these errors, you often have to trace the problem backwards from the program output to the source of the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three types of error are located and corrected (hopefully) in the process known as **debugging**."

    "\n",
    "All joking aside, you simply can't always write code that works. I can't do it, professional developers can't do it, and you shouldn't expect yourself to do it either. Instead, approach writing code with the knowledge that things will go wrong. Debugging then becomes a path of mastery as you dig deeper into your problematic code, checking your assumptions and testing your knowledge. If you get stuck, be patient."

Including well-written, concise comments in your code gives anyone who reads your code the opportunity to see what the code is supposed to do. You can use comments to explain a particularly complicated section of code, to remind the reader of the flow of your program, or to justify certain choices you made when writing the code.\n",

Once that task is complete, we may not look at the code again for several weeks, months, or even years. To avoid having to re-learn how everything was done, line by line, you can leave yourself helpful comments that describe your reasoning and the intended function of your code. You will thank your past self for being such a considerate and responsible developer.\n",
