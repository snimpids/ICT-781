    "Consider the following problem. Jim is on the main floor of a building. He presses the elevator call button with the intention of traveling to the 12th floor of the building. The elevator must keep track of the number of stops it makes as it travels up. Suppose that 4 other people appear and get on the elevator with Jim, and they press the buttons for the 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 10th floors. Write a Python program that simulates the elevator as it keeps track of how many stops it needs to make, as well as the floor it is currently stopped at.\n",
