However, `removeCard` doesn't just check if the attributes are the same, but if the card we passed in **is** an object in the Deck. This is called a **deep comparison**. Therefore, `removeCard` will always return `False`, since we are asking it to find our newly created `Card(...)` argument in a list of previously created cards, which is impossible.\n",
